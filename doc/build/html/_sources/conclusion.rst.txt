Conclusions
=================

The next paragraphs will contain a small summary of the lessons learned in the project:
Comments about the development, acquired knowledge and a evaluation of the product.

The first consideration commented between those who form *The Sheriff Team* is that
we didn't expect to deliver something that was going to work in this short period of time.
We were frightened of the fact that we had to deliver a project from scratch in less than
two months.
Now that tests are passing and we have a final code organised and clean, we are very proud
of the achieved result.

The second consideration is that *The Sheriff Team* is formed by people with very different
work experience in the programming world. Taking this into account, we consider that all of us,
every one in his own level, has learnt a lot and has had the opportunity to apply the concepts
learnt in class. Mostly in design concepts, but also in how to build a correct infrastructure,
the level of knowledge of every one has growth a lot.
