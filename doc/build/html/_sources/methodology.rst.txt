Development Methodology
=======================

The team tried to follow an Scrum-like approach to organize the application
development. The following tools were used to help them out:

* `GitHub <https://github.com>`_

  * **GitHub** has been used as `code repository <https://github.com/tripledes/thesheriff>`_,
    for managing the `project <https://github.com/tripledes/thesheriff/projects>`_ and
    its `task <https://github.com/tripledes/thesheriff/projects/1>`_,
    keep track of `issues <https://github.com/tripledes/thesheriff/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue>`_
    and review `code changes <https://github.com/tripledes/thesheriff/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr>`_.

* `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org>`_

  * **Travis CI** provided a free platform where to run the tests,
    specially when sending changes to the code repository as it
    was configured to test pull requests and merges into the master branch.

* `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org>`_

  * **ReadTheDocs** is a documentation platform, which provides free accounts
    and integrates with **GitHub** through the use of webhooks, so on each
    commit to master the documentation is rebuilt and `published <http://thesheriff.rtd.io>`_.

* `Google Hangouts <https://hangouts.google.com/>`_

  * Google Hangouts was mainly used for remote meetings.
