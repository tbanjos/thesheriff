<p>In the design stage of <em>The Sheriff</em> application, it was figured out that
the best architecture style to start building the project was
the <strong>Hexagonal Architecture</strong>.</p>
<p>This decision was taken for three main reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is the one and only style practiced in class.
(The others will be taught in other subjects in the future)</p></li>
<li><p>The requirements of the application can be easily split in different layers:
Use cases are very clear, model objects can be easily distinguished
and finally is mentioned that there will have to be used some mail
and database services that can be located in an outer layer.</p></li>
<li><p>It is easy to maintain due to the aforementioned modularity
and because of this outer layer named infrastructure can be
replaced in an straightforward way.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Effectively, in the next lines is going to be explained what exactly
is this architecture. Later, the design decisions and the patterns
taken, and finally, some problems that have forced the team
to, at least, discuss their initial approach.</p>
<div class="section" id="hexagonal-architecture">
<h2>Hexagonal Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#hexagonal-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <em>Hexagonal Architecture</em> is a software architectural style
that allows the developer to easily distinguish between
the outer and the inner part of the software, using three
main layers: <strong>Infrastructure, Application and Domain</strong> (ordered
from the external to the internal part).</p>
<p>The external part, the Infrastructure, is basically formed by the
<strong>User’s Interface, database and messaging servies</strong>.</p>
<p>In the middle layer, the Application, is basically formed
by the application <strong>use cases</strong>.</p>
<p>In the inner layer, the Domain, there are basically model <strong>objects</strong>,
the concept representation of the business.</p>
<p>This organisation allows for a higher level of <strong>isolation, testability,</strong>
and <strong>control</strong> over the code. Each layer of the application has a strict
set of responsibilities and requirements. This <strong>separates</strong> the <strong>logic</strong>
and the <strong>functionality</strong>, and shows how those layers should interact
with each other.</p>
<p>In the next lines it is going to be explained how concretely in <em>The Sheriff</em>
application this architecture has been managed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-sheriff-design">
<h2>The Sheriff Design<a class="headerlink" href="#the-sheriff-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After analysing <em>The Sheriff</em> requirements, the first task to be done
was to define the concept of the application, so the design of the Domain.
Later, the next task was to identify the use cases in the Application layer
and finally create the Infrastructure and decide the technologies used.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the domain.</p>
<div class="section" id="domain">
<h3>Domain<a class="headerlink" href="#domain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Here there were designed the main domain entities: <strong>Outlaw</strong>, <strong>Gang</strong>
and <strong>Raid</strong>. This classes contain all pertinent business logic: <strong>variables</strong>
that define the object and <strong>methods</strong> that access these variables and also
do some basic logic related to its concept.</p>
<p>Above see the example of the <strong>Gang</strong> class:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/gang_object.png"><img alt="Gang class example" class="align-center" src="_images/gang_object.png" style="width: 291.5px; height: 198.0px;" /></a>
<p>The next design pattern to add would be a creational pattern. It was
desired to abstract the creation of these objects defined before,
so there were created <strong>factories</strong> for every domain entity that would
have a <strong>create factory method</strong>.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/gang_factory.png"><img alt="Gang Factory example" class="align-center" src="_images/gang_factory.png" style="width: 289.6px; height: 102.0px;" /></a>
<p>Finally, again for every model object, it was designed a <strong>“repository”</strong>
interface, where it will be located all the methods to implement
the <strong>contracts</strong>. These repositories are very important because
these will be the classes that will be injected in the pertinent use cases
(Application) and also implemented in Infrastructure.</p>
<p>During the design of the infrastructure repositories and the domain entities,
there were several discussions about which kind of objects
some of their implemented methods should return.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/gang_repository.png"><img alt="Gang Factory example" class="align-center" src="_images/gang_repository.png" style="width: 286.40000000000003px; height: 196.0px;" /></a>
<p>At this point it was identified that some concepts were not being
taken into account. Later on, in the middle of the project’s life,
we discovered that we had to add new classes to fulfill some use cases.</p>
<p>Due to the requirements related with create/end raids we discovered
that we needed an Outlaw derived class named <strong>Sheriff</strong>, an outlaw with
extra features. This Sheriff, regarding the raid, would need some attributes
grouped in another class named <strong>Score</strong> for rating the raids. Finally,
regarding domain, due to the use case of sending notifications that would
bring us to send notifications by email, a class named <strong>Mail</strong> was designed
(with its <strong>Factory</strong> and <strong>Notifier</strong>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="application">
<h3>Application<a class="headerlink" href="#application" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Application contains the main <strong>use cases</strong> identified by the team
and also some complementary ones:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>List gangs</p></li>
<li><p>Create gang</p></li>
<li><p>Create outlaw</p></li>
<li><p>Create raid</p></li>
<li><p>Invite friend</p></li>
<li><p>Join gang</p></li>
<li><p>List friends</p></li>
<li><p>List gangs</p></li>
<li><p>Rate raid</p></li>
<li><p>Grade raid</p></li>
<li><p>End raid</p></li>
<li><p>Send notifications</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These use cases generally contain <strong>injected</strong> their <strong>collaborators</strong> and have
an <strong>execute</strong> method to trigger the action of the use case they implement.
There were several discussions about to unify or separate use cases
(concretely those that refer to do some actions in the raid).
Finally, the solution was to separate them and trigger them separately too.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/gang_use_case.png"><img alt="Gang use case example" class="align-center" src="_images/gang_use_case.png" style="width: 355.5px; height: 106.0px;" /></a>
<p>In this layer it was also designed an approach to deal with the information
received from the endpoint. The <strong>Request</strong> classes, located in the controller,
were created to abstract the needed information to execute the pertinent
use case in an outer class, to ease
the <abbr title="Single Responsibility Principle">SRP</abbr>.</p>
<p>The Requests classes are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Join Gang Request</p></li>
<li><p>Create Gang Request</p></li>
<li><p>Create Outlaw request</p></li>
<li><p>Create Raid Request</p></li>
<li><p>Rate Raid Request</p></li>
<li><p>End Raid Request</p></li>
</ul>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/request_snippet.png"><img alt="Request Object example" class="align-center" src="_images/request_snippet.png" style="width: 407.4px; height: 250.2px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="section" id="infrastructure">
<h3>Infrastructure<a class="headerlink" href="#infrastructure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Infrastructure contains the <abbr title="Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface">RESTful API</abbr> endpoints and MySQL
repositories.</p>
<p>These endpoints are triggered within the <strong>controllers</strong> that have <strong>injected</strong>
their required <strong>use cases</strong> as collaborators to achieve the needed
functionality and <strong>invoke</strong> these pertinent use cases
(see the image above, focusing on the GangController).</p>
<p>The MySQL repositories implement the contracts defined by the domain
interfaces. Take the following image as an example:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/sql_gang_repo.png"><img alt="MySQL repository example" class="align-center" src="_images/sql_gang_repo.png" style="width: 258.59999999999997px; height: 150.0px;" /></a>
<p>To fulfill the use cases that implied to send a notification,
<strong>SMTP Mail Notifier</strong> was also included as collaborator.</p>
<p>All the problems dealt with in this package were which technologies
to choose, and all this information can be found in the
next section, which focuses on Infrastructure details.</p>
